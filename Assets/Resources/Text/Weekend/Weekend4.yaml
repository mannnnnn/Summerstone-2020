- R: Agelaius, Sternella, come quick!
- A: Beg pardon?
- S: Oh silly wolf, we don't answer to the call of mortals!
- R: Please, there's something-
- H: What is all this?
- R: Hedera, thank god. Something is attacking the mice!
- H: What? Who?
- R: I don't know, I couldn't see anything!
- R: I heard reports that the mice were in danger, but when I rushed down there-
- R: The first colony was already destroyed. The survivors fled to the next colony.
- R: I sent my men to help but I fear it's too late.
- R: This came out of nowhere, and it has to be magical in nature.
- A: And how are you sure of such things?
- R: No creature in the Durell Woods would harm the mice, especially not after this week's happenings.
- R: But we found their broken bodies all the same.
- R: Not eaten or killed by any natural cause, just- dead. Mauled.
- R: Please.
- H: I will accompany you. Come.
- A: Hm.
- S: Those poor mice.
- S: Shall we-?
- A: We must do what we can.
- A: Stay by the stone, and I will deal with the mice.
- A: Let us pray the Summerstone will aid us as well.
