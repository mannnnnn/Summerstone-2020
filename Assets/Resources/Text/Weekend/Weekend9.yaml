- H: Have you already checked through this stack?
- R: Yes.
- H: And what about this one.
- R: Yes, Hedera.
- H: But what-
- R: All of the books have been checked.
- R: I'm afraid to say... I think this is a dead end.
- H: Outrageous how one little dog can write so much.
- H: And yet never write anything of substance.
- B: Well, the best stories are always told in person!
- H: O-oh! Mister Bark! I, eh- 
- O: I couldn't keep him distracted...
- O: Um... sorry Senior Bark for tearing up your library.
- B: They should be sorry for taking them away.
- B: But I should really be apologizing to you, Oxx. I really should have returned these books sooner.
- O: Huh?
- B: And all this time I've been dilly-dallying about chatting to try to distract you.
- B: But the time's finally come, take them back.
- O: I think your joke is going over my head.
- B: Nonsense, no joke! The mice should have their books back.
- R: Back?
- R: You didn't write these?
- B: Heavens no! I just borrowed them from the library of the mice.
- H: The library of the mice?
- H: I've never heard of such a thing.
- R: When was the last time you took a book out from them, father?
- B: Oh I don't know.
- B: A few hundred years ago?
- B: About the time they were finishing up the Summerstone.
- H: You're kidding me.
- H: You were there for the creation of the Summerstone?
- O: The mice... created the Summerstone?
- B: Oh sure thing! It was the hottest thing to talk about!
- B: There was this human, Riddance, who talked about helping run the forest.
- B: The mice built this large stone alter, imbued it with some magic, told him he was gonna be king of the forest.
- B: Then Riddance went off somewhere and we all laughed about it, and the Summerstone was created.
- H: The first spirit of the Summerstone must have been Riddance, then? A human?
- B: Well I don't know anything about that.
- R: You don't know anything about anything.
- O: Hush! I want to know more!
- O: Good Bark, tell me... why did the mice make the Summerstone.
- B: Ah beats me, I don't pay attention to all that hogwash. It's just a fancy rock out there is all.
- O: But... you know that the human, Riddance. Died on the Summerstone.
- B: Well I'm not sure if-
- O: Did you hear of anyone else who mysteriously vanished at the Summerstone?
- B: Nope!
- O: What about the mice, why did they stop doing magic?
- B: Oh, well once they got their fancy stone up and polished, they mainly backed away from the whole arcane enchantment thing.
- B: Some inconsiderate fool took all the books from their library so none of us could check out more.
- B: And then the rock sat unattended until you all started sitting around it.
- H: There were no sacrifices between now and then...
- R: -Meaning that Riddance, the first Summerstone sacrifice.
- H: -Was the only sacrifice before our Summerstone. There's only ever been one Summerstone. Trapped in the rock for hundreds of years.
- O: Alone. Killed and then abandoned by the mice.
- B: Well don't you folks have pleasant conversations.
- B: Anyways, keep the books. I can't read anyhow.
- B: Sorry for hogging them all this time, little Oxx!
- R: We're fighting the first Summerstone.
- R: Riddance.
- H: We're going to be fighting the entity that essentially ran this forest until he went mad.
- H: Perhaps... we should gather our armaments.
