- H: It's good to see you here again Oxx, I was concerned how you were handling it all.
- H: ...
- H: Wait.
- B: Ain't no mousey here!
- H: You again?
- B: ~Ya da do da dooooo~
- H: Why are you here?
- R: What kind of question is that?
- R: I just got here.
- H: Not you, I was talking to...
- H: Nevermind, have you seen my apprentice?
- R: You mean my new pack member.
- H: Pardon?
- H: But he has many duties to yet complete.
- R: He also lost his family, Hedera.
- R: My wolves have provided aid where they could and you prevented him joining the cause.
- R: You focused on stone scratches and magic.
- R: On the Summerstone that allowed this to happen.
- H: I must be diligent in my work so we can prevent such a thing to happen again.
- H: Oxx's wounds will heal with time, he will return when he's ready.
- R: If he returns.
- R: Have you even thought of consoling your ex-apprentice?
- H: ...
- H: Sternella and Agelaius have not yet returned.
- H: Perhaps they require assistance in the investigation.
