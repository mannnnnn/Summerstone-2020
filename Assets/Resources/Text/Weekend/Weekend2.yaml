- S: Oh Agelaius, it's terrible!
- S: All the wolves are back, eating up all the little creatures.
- A: That's how the food chain works, Sternella.
- S: They hound down the travellers off the paths as well, how are people supposed to return?
- A: The weather is bright and clear, and there are sales to be made.
- A: The humans will return in time, despite the danger.
- S: But there's no reason for this! Rubus can curb his packs...
- R: Did I overhear my name?

- R: Do you two intend to sit around the Summerstone all day?
- A: And all night.
- A: Don't worry. It's no bother to us.
- R: I wasn't- Alright, answer me this, do you intend to live in Durell Woods from this point forward?
- S: That's the plan!
- R: And you don't want to scamper off to wherever you came from?

- S: Got it.
- R: We must hunt what we can.
- S: But not the cute things, please.
- R: That's not-

- R: No.
- A: I would advise against it.
- R: Fine.
- R: Let the bloody Summerstone decide.
- R: It knows best for the forest after all.
