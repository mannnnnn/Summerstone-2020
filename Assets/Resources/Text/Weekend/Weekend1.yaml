- R: The forest...
- H: Yes, I saw it too.
- H: Everyone is returning to the Durell Woods.
- H: The Summerstone, it answers our call.
- R: I'll be frank, hart, I didn't think this would work.
- H: I had my doubts as well.
- H: I did not think that help would be coming.
- R: But someone is doing this.
- H: The Summerstone, no doubt.
- R: Maybe, maybe not. Perhaps we just had to weather the storm.
- H: Are you saying that these changes we see before us are mere coincidence?
- R: I'm saying that the next time I ask for advice and you tell me to take these dire measures-
- R: I'm going to think twice before agreeing.
- H: Look at all the lives we've been able to save.
- R: You attribute this directly to your own works and rituals.
- R: My people want me to tell them what brought about this change.
- R: And what shall I tell them?
- R: That a deer dragged a human to its death to possess a magic stone?
- H: Yes.
- R: You're absurd.
- H: The truth often is.
- R: We cannot rely on practices which shed blood such as this.
- H: This was our only option.
- H: If you had not believed me, why did you assist me?
- R: I... cannot deny what I've seen.
- R: I only wish I had a better means to show the creatures of the woods what exactly we're dealing with.
- R: Who... exactly we're dealing with.
- R: We need to see who the Summerstone truly is.
- H: A display of power?
- R: A sign, at the very least.
