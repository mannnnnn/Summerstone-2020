- O: Lady Agelaius, I had a question.
- A: Back already, little one?
- O: What? No!
- O: I mean-
- O: Hrm.
- O: Can I just ask you a question?
- A: Go ahead.
- O: Would... would it be possible for another Summerstone to exist?
- A: Another Summerstone?
- O: Well you said that there were traces of the Summerstone's magic around my village.
- O: And I just thought-
- O: Maybe there's another Summerstone somewhere? A bad one?
- A: Ah.
- A: I'm sorry Oxx, but I can assure you there is no structure such as the one you see here.
- A: The rock that forms the Summerstone was hewn many years ago, when I was alive.
- O: When you were alive?
- A: When I was- 
- A: ... I was alive. That sounds odd to say outloud.
- O: You used to be someone? You weren't always a spirit.
- A: I was not. Though... I don't know much about what I was.
- A: Or why I am like this now.
- A: I wonder... why am I here at all.
- A: Why do we guard the Summerstone?
- O: O-oh. Sorry, I didn't mean to make you, um-
- O: Question your whole existence and everything.
- A: Don't fret, little mouse.
- A: To be mortal is to question your whole existence all the time.
- A: I've been devoid of this feeling for most time I can recall.
- A: It's odd to ponder it now.
- A: You have a knack for asking big questions, little one.
- O: I'm... I'm gonna try to follow a lead too.
- O: I"m gonna try, for the last time.
- A: Then as my sister would say:
- A: Best of luck.
