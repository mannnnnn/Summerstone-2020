- A: You two are back again.
- H: Indeed, it is our duty.
- R: And you two are both injured. You should rest.
- A: Are you indebted to the stone because you were the ones who killed the human?
- A: Do you serve this spot because you feel guilt for spilling that blood?
- H: ...
- R: ... Yes. At least for myself.
- R: We sacrificed a life which was not ours, to save a forest.
- R: And all the life within.
- R: I look after this forest, so it is my duty to continue to serve the Summerstone.
- R: And to look after the spirit within, who I count as a resident of the forest.
- H: And ... likewise for myself.
- H: I am a master of the forest's magic, the Summerstone is the cornerstone of that magic.
- H: Yet... I know very little.
- H: And had I understood more, perhaps this disaster would not have been brought about.
- A: I see...
- A: Your words are... familiar.
- H: Familiar? How so?
- S: The spirit who attacked us...
- S: I knew it.
- S: I recognized it.
- R: You what?
- R: What was it?
- S: It was... the Summerstone.
- S: The Old Summerstone.
- A: The one we, no doubt, sacrificed long ago.
- H: I beg your pardon?
- A: The reason we cannot leave the Summerstone, it is the same as why you continue to return.
- A: We all have our debts to pay.
- A: And our debtor has returned.
- H: Your debtor has returned, what does that mean?
- A: I am not entirely certain.
- S: And I am tired.
- H: But you need to elabor-
- R: Hedera.
- R: We will leave you two spirits be.
- R: They need time to recover, Hedera.
- H: Very well.
- H: But perhaps-
- R: They are injured creatures, let them rest.
