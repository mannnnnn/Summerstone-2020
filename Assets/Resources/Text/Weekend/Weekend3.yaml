- O: Mister Rubus, there's been an incident?
- R: Has there now.
- R: What else is going wrong in this blasted forest?
- O: Please sir, there was a band of humans heading towards the Summerstone a few days ago.
- O: I hid when they arrived, but they searched all over, pulled me from my hiding spot.
- O: I scurried away, but when I was running I thought I saw tears on their faces.
- R: Tears? Of a human?
- A: It's true, I witnessed them myself.
- A: A band of humans became lost in the woods nearly a week ago. The others are distraught.
- A: Sternella has been searching for them relentlessly, but...
- R: Hm.
- R: I can rally some men together to go search.
- R: But I may not be able to gather as many as necessary to scan the entire woods.
- R: This sets quite a precedent. The humans are passerbys, not residents of the woods.
- R: I cannot promise to always lend a hand in fishing them out of trouble.
- R: And I certainly cannot ask my wolves to spend their precious daylight dogging after their hunters.
- O: But-
- R: Ah, do not worry, little one.
- R: I may have my hands tied, but look at this here rock.
- R: The Summerstone has great power, and within it resides the power to see and control the entire forest.
- R: Perhaps it will find them and send them home.
