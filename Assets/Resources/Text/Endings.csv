"Rubus avoided the Summerstone as its magic continued to seep away. Broken and destroyed, the spirits of Night and Day had assured him that it would last no longer, and that the forest would once again subside into the chaos and decay from which it had only recently overcome. This sat heavily on Rubus, but there was absolution in his heart this time. There would be no more sacrifices for the Summerstone. The forest would have to be left behind, and this time it would be early. The deer, the small critters, everyone was ordered out, to wander among the world until their homes could be found. The wolves stayed behind, gathering what they could and spreading the word to save as many as possible. Some chastised Rubus, but most went willingly. When the Summerstone finally broke, the life drained out of the forest alongside it, and the wolves went away as well. Rubus was the last to leave in this time, and as he wandered the forests for the final time, he startled to the sound of a wolf pup left behind. He searched for days, hunting for the elusive sound of a creature in peril. On the last day, he followed the sound to the Summerstone's grove, now dead and dried, and dug at the base of the stone where the owner's bones lie. There, within the dirt, the small pup lay, unharmed. Rubus knew at once that this was the one who had accompanied him all this time, the sweet Summerstone who he had slain so many months ago. Rubus took the child with him on the road and raised it like his own, savoring not only his second chance at making things right, but the company of a precious new member of the pack.",,"Hedera stayed alongside the Summerstone until the bitter end. His bones grew weak and brittle, but it was the Summerstone who gave out first. One night, in the sacred glade, Hedera returned to find the rock devoid of life. The magic which had permeated the meadow had faded away, gently and absolutely. The trees withered, the grass dried... there was truly nothing left for him there. But, there was something else pulling at him, urging him away. With heavy limbs, he made his way up to the top of the cliffface nearby. In the night, the balmy summer air whistled past, illuminating the night sky in visions of soft pale lights. Arcane magics whispered on this wind, pulling him further and further out onto the cliff. Gazing up into the night sky, he felt the presence of the one who had urged him this far, who had comforted him until his final days. It was finally time to go, to leave this forest to whatever it may become. He knew, though, that his journey would not be made alone. Hedera wept, knowing that he had finally found a friend willing to walk him to the end.",,"Sternella waits alongside the Summerstone as it fades away, her own body broken and destroyed in the fight as well. She basks in the sun, lapping up the warm rays of light, until eventually the world begins to fade around her. Soon the worries and troubles of others seem like a distant thing, and there is little to be concerned with. Agelaius bids her sister farewell, and the two depart, seperated for the first time in many a year. It's not a sad farewell though. Both had grown accostomed to each other, but sisters they were not. Sternella takes flight once again, leaving a final time, and flying off into the sun to whatever life holds next. An unexpected companion follows her, growing wings and setting itself alight as the two spirits fly high into the sky, letting the world continue without them, as it had been before.",,"Agelaius guards the Summerstone jealously in its final days. Its magic seeps away every morn, giving its last to the forest. Agelaius's injuries soon mirror the Summerstone's and there is little more that she can do other than perch alongside the stone and keep watch in the night. Soon, she becomes indistinguishable from it, blending into the plum shades of the sunset and vanishing completely as the stars come out. The Summerstone fades away before she does, and as it leaves for the final time, Agelaius feels her wings return to her, after so many years. She flees into the night, leaving without a single word to her so-called sister. The wind beneath her wings laughs and spurs her on, a trusty companion to the last. The arcane remanents of the Summerstone wrap their magics around the final bonds of the Spirit of Night, releasing her into the realm in which she longs to go. As the spirit of the Summerstone falls into the dark nothingness, Agelaius dives deep and catches it, dragging it up with her into the moonlight to live forevermore.",,"The young fieldmouse, Oxx, continued making his trips to the Summerstone in secret. The breaking of the Summerstone had been a final blow against the small creature, the last piece of his past that was now gone. As he made his way late one night to the remnants of the Summerstone, he could tell that the rock was finally destroyed. No remnants of magic clung to the air, and the glade lay barren around him. This was not, however, what caught the mouse's eye. Rather, in the midst of the cleaved Summerstone, a small whispy figure sat. Oxx approached it with caution, afraid for what sort of spirit could have been freed from such a disaster. His worry soon fell away though, for he recognized who stood before him. It was, of course, the one who had helped him all this time, the sweet listener who had heard his pleas when the world had worked around him. Oxx and the white mouse ran off without another word. There is an understanding between those who have lost all that they are at the hands of those bigger and bolder then they. Oxx and the Summerstone left without the knowledge of anyone else in the forest, and what happened to them is a mystery to all who knew them.",,"What can be said about Bark? That he was a hero? That he was remembered fondly? I'm afraid not. He simply lived out the remainder of his days as the oddity which he was. The Summerstone was destroyed, and with it the hopes of the creatures of the forest. The entirety of the land died around it, and the creatures were quick to flee, but of course Bark had not left before, and he would not leave now. The old dog continued his work same as he had before. By all means, he should not have survived in the forest, and by all means he should not have been as happy as he had right to be. That little patch of forest which he called home, though, it continued to prosper. The world forgot about Bark again, as it had before, but he continued to live on. The world forgot about the Summerstone, but its spirit kept the dog companion. Bark reassured it that the world would continue, and that immortality would be a hoot if you didn't mind living a bit on the absurd side.",,"The battle against Riddance was long and hard, but in the end, the creatures of the forest were victorious. The Spirits of Night and Day fought bravely, driving away Riddance's attacks again and again and saving many lives in the fray. It was, however, Rubus and Hedera who were the true heroes in the story. As Riddance had moved to destroy the Summerstone and free the spirit within, they had sacrificed themselves upon its alter to save the stone. And those who die upon the Summerstone, well, they live on in other ways. Rubus and Hedera's spirits overcame Riddance and destroyed its bindings to this worldly realm. While their bodies lie broken and destroyed, they joined the human which they had killed long ago. The three of them forevermore would reside in the Summerstone, taking in the long years of silence and solidarity to the forest in stride. They would not suffer as Riddance did, for despite the toil and strife which would reach their ears, they would have companionship among each other. The Spirits of Night and Day continued as the guardians of the Summerstone, and so long did they stand in the grove that they themselves became statues to watch over the creatures who came to visit and share their problems. And do not fret over the loss of magic in the forest, for the young mouse Oxx soon took up Hedera's mantle in the forest as the leading teacher of arcane arts, as his people had done many, many, years ago. And when Oxx grew old, he took an apprentice of his own, a young human who had strayed into the forest long ago. The creatures of the forest lived long and happy lives, and the Durell Woods continue to stand to this very day. And that, dear friend, is the story of the Summerstone."
