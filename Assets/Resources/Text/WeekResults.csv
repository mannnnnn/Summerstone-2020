WolfResult1,Life Returns,"The cruel conditions of the forest begin to ease up as summer begins to return in earnest. The brown and decayed thistles and leaves begin to twitch and draw themselves back to life. A few nervous creatures begin to venture back into the Durell woods, and at the heart they find the Summerstone aglow with power once more. The first travellers run with joy back to their homes, hastened by the bright sun beating down on their paths, as they carry the good news of the forest's return.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult1,Summerstone Returns,"It starts out simple, with just a shimmer of light in the dead of night. A few creatures begin to stay up late, watching as the skies themselves begin to unfold, little by little. Stars of every color and brightness pop and sparkle in the night sky, blossoming into a flurry of constellations above the Durrell Woods. Hundreds of living creatures begin to chart their return, guided on by the glittering mass of light.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WolfResult2,Niche,"More and more creatures filter into the forest, brought around by the bright sun and warm earth. They move around each other gracefully, but warily to start. A few conflicts arise as wolves and deer live side-by-side, competing and hunting with each other at their throats, but then something fascinating happens. The land draws chasms, and within those chasms arise great ravines and caves where creatures find their niche. Their interactions with each other become amicable as each finds their own little spot in the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult2,The Hart's Peace,"A few flowers sprung up in front of the Summerstone the first night. Hedera dared to hope that it was a sign, but his heart was old and scepticle of believing such things. The next night, it was a small pool of water by the side of his cave, so he wouldn't have to wander far to get drink. Every night, a new gift arrived from the Summerstone, and Hedera wept not only for the joy of knowing such a kind soul was on his side, but also for the thought that perhaps the Summerstone knew how forced his hand had been when this had all started.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult2,Cartography,"The humans were unwelcome in the forest from the start, but the Spirit of Day kept her eyes trained on them all the same. She giggled with glee each time they ventured past their paths, and she left them tokens as they passed by. The first few travellers found a good landmark, a large stone in the middle of a meadow. When they made it to their destinations, they told the next set of travellers how to navigate by the rock's location. Soon, every human was passing by the Summerstone, and Sternella supervised them with a happy heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult2,Preservation,"The creatures were happy to once again be in their homes, running about in the balmy summer air without fear of what the air might carry. They built homes and workplaces, stores and storages, but when night fell they put down their tools. For, upon their arrival, a great stone amphiteathere had arisen out of the ground on the far side of the woods. Once the sun had set, beasts of all shapes and sizes ventured to the theatre as the lamps were lit, and watched as the actors regaled the woods with stories of how things had been, and what could be.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WolfResult3,Lean-To,"The creatures of the woods begin to notice their beloved leader Rubus making routine trips to a stone in the woods. A few begin to follow him in secret, hearing him spill his troubles to the rock. Some know the truth, but most are confused. Confusion leads to a gentle sort of understanding though as they sit by the rock and share their troubles, as they had seen the wise wolf do. Soon, Rubus finds himself with a bit more time to rest as wolves, deer, and mice alike travel to the Summerstone in secret to spill their woes and wishes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult3,Fleetfoot,"The young mouse, Oxx, speeds along his trails every night, winding his way back home. As he does so though, he begins to feel someone's presence beside him as he runs. The presence guides him off paths and through the darker areas of the woods, into sunlit meadows and damp caves. He finds curse-ridden bones and flighted beasts in his travels, burning with dark magics Hedera has yet to teach. These are the things which intrigue a young mind, and these are the things which Oxx dreams about in the night.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult3,The Rotting Rabbit,"The mice discover a new plant growing by the side of their town. At first, it's ugly and crude, a vile black vine curling up from the ground. They pass it by without much thought, and watch as it blossoms out into a sort of mushroom. After devising a few names for the new species, they eagerly cut it down, only to find the insides full of a bright, glowing fur. The creatures are puzzled at how such a thing could be, but quickly harvest and replant the mushrooms. They keep only the first batch for themselves, sewing thicker coats for their pups. The rest of the crop is left to the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult3,Baskets,"On the doorstep of every creature, a woven basket is placed. No one knows how the tradition was started, but it continues earnestly for the rest of time. If you do not have one, you are to weave a basket out of dried grasses and leave it out on your porch until the break of day. The dew collected within the basket turns to the most wonderful foods once the moon is at its highest peak, and you hear a bird singing in the distance. No one questions these things, but every day you set aside a little bit of time to make the basket nicer, or weave a new one altogether.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OxxResult3,Young Eyes,"In the dead of night, Rubus meets with Oxx, Sternella, and Agelauis to dig up the bones of the slain human who became the Summerstone. The spirits of Day and Night watch as the young Oxx sadly pulls the freshly grown flowers off the Summerstone's plot, and begins to dig into the soil. When the mouse fails to find the bones, it is Rubus himself who tears up the earth, driven by guilt. No bones are found though, and everyone departs. The next morning as Oxx returns, though, the plot has been filled once again, the flowers atop it as normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult3,Clueless,"What can be said of Bark? Little that the creatures of the woods know about. There's a sort of vigor in the way he steps around, and a strange mirth in the way he speaks to you. The funniest thing, though, is how the forest itself seems to part for him. Whenever you'd think that a root might trip him up, you look again and it's gone. The briars and burrs in his fur seem to disappear soon as they tangle themselves. Some thought maybe he was a powerful being. Others thought maybe the world just makes life easier for the light-hearted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult4,The Mighty and the Meek,"The next few days are rough, especially on the mice as the days go from bad to worse. Fortunately though, the wolves come and make good on their promise, delivering aid and supplies to the mice as they struggle with the deaths of their fellow colonies. As disasters continue to befall the remaining mice, the deer and other creatures of the woods begin to check in and help out with whatever they can. Wolves sleep alongside the homes of mice, curling up beside the small huts with their massive hulking frames, and the mice are able to sleep sound at night with the aid of the forest beasts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult4,Shelter,"The scratchings continue, night after night as the base of the Summerstone becomes worn away. Sternella and Agelaius guard the stone jealously, growing more and more frustrated as no sign of the perpetrator appears. Eventually, Hedera himself begins to spend his nights besides the stone, giving up his warm bed and shelter to guard his life's work. Answers are few and far between, but the old deer is taken care of. No rain falls on his bones as he sleeps by the side of the stone, and the warm breeze blankets him throughout the night. He is safe beneath the watch of the Summerstone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult4,The Riders,"The fourth mouse colony befalls a sudden disaster halfway through the week as a stampede of deer tear through their homes without noticing. With their huts and storage destroyed, the mice pack up to leave and move to a new location. The crestfallen deer, however, realized their mistake and returned to the mice to offer their help. Unsure of how else to assist, the deer offered transportation for the mice as they moved to join their brethern. The mice quickly took them up on their offer, strapping their meager belongings to the backs of the deer and hopping aboard to ride off. Oddly enough though, the deer never reached the other mouse civilizations. Both the deer and the mice seemed to have left the woods, following the siren song of something else off in the distance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult4,The Lost Mice,"A light rain falls over the forest in the dead of night, closely monitored by Agelaius from her perch above the Summerstone. The night is quiet, the little noises drowned out by the pelting rain. When all seems fine, Agelaius lifts her head to notice the clouds parting up above, revealing a new constellation in the sky. She begrudgingly leaves her home to go follow the stars, and finds an abandoned mouse settlement at the end of the constellation. A few weakened mice sit beneath the shabbles of houses, and she rescues the children, bringing them safetly home to their families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OxxResult4,Twig Collector,"Early in the morning, Oxx collected perfectly-sized wooden twigs from the forest floor and brought them back to the homes the fieldmice community. While they eventually broke down and were discarded, these twigs were perfect for chewing and therepeutic in these trying times. This created the occupation of ""twig collector"" for a small handfull of mice, who completed their job in earnest in order to raise morale.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult4,Errant Errands,"Bark's ventures were as odd as the man himself. While he mainly kept holed up in his waterfall house, the man occasionally travelled out of the Durrell woods for many days on end, returning covered in sand and seaweed with a packet of tea in his mouth. No one knew how he got tea, as no popular variants of tea leaves grew near the woods. No one knew of any sort of shore or ocean nearby either, but still these visits continued. In the late week however, a Bark once again set off to go retrieve his beverage goods, he was surprised to find a pack of the tea left outside his doorstep. Regardless of the gift, he tried to leave the woods again, but walked straight into an invisible barrier keeping him from leaving. After barking at it for quite some time, he eventually accepted the gift and headed back inside to enjoy a good book, completely forgetting about how the tea had arrived under these mysterious circumstances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult5,Hideaway,"After spending a considerable amount of time trailing the deer, the wolf pack tasked with reporting any suspicious movement discovered something else entirely. Looking over his shoulder multiple times but finding nothing due to the crafty wolves blending into their surroundings, Hedera walked further and further away from the populated areas of the forest. Only then, in what he believed to be solitude, did he allow himself to grieve. Rubus ended the investigation immediately afterwards and told the wolves to keep quiet on what they saw.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult5,Truant,"Hedera waits for a while every day, hoping that the young mouse Oxx will return to his studies, but the mouse remains sullen and distant. The old hart doesn't pursue, but the mornings feel empty with the absence of the pupil. Still, Hedera gathers his old texts and leaves them beside where the young mouse's favorite spots. Sometimes they sat there and collected morning dew, other times they were gone before the hart got back.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult5,Restoration,"The next few days are sullen, but there is little to be done. The mice are buried, and the forest is left with the question of what is to be done regarding their absence. The Spirit of Day rounds up a few bands of ferrets to run about and gather information on how to best fill the holes that the mice left in everyone's lives. Besides Oxx, it seemed as though the mice mostly kept to themselves in the forest. While their civilizations are shambles after the onslaught, the ferrets begin to repair and restore the houses and storerooms in their absence. A few stick around to continue their research on the mice, but it is a menagerie of other smaller creatures who end up flocking to the restored settlements. Among them, supposedly, even one of old Rubus's wolves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult5,Not Alone,"The nights grow long and restless as the creatures of the forest sleep with one eye open, afraid of what lurks in the shadows. If the mice could be so easily wiped out, who's to say that anyone else is safe. No one dares sleep under the light of the moon, instead they find the nooks and crannies within which to hide and peer out. While the creatures of the forest are devoid of comfort, they learn to stay vigilant in the night. Nocturnal predators get smarter, and prey gets more cunning. Everyone is on alert now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OxxResult5,Mourning,"A soft rain falls, cleaning away some of the more gruesome bloodshed from the mouse massacre. The wolves come with Oxx and help locate the bodies of his loved ones and dig holes for them to return to the ground. Oxx takes the time to properly mourn the loss of his family and the rain allows him to cry more than his self-consiousness would usually allow. The assistance he is given in his grief is beyond words and he clings onto the wolf pack as if they were the family he lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult5,Arrogance?,"Bark the dog, oblivious as ever, continues his routine of running about. Many creatures of the forest are appalled at his behaviour, skipping about and singing as if everything was back to normal. No one dares confront him about it though, and instead they whisper while he is away, and shoot him nasty glares. As the routine continues though, eventually it becomes less and less fun to talk about the old man. He slowly just becomes a constant in everyone's lives once more, and to a few his routine is comforting on a surreal level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult6,The Arcane Pup,"Oxx fits in well with the wolves, though it comes as no surprise to Rubus. He slowly regains his footing in the world, becoming a wild and reckless youth in ways that he never exhibited under Hedera's tuteliage. It becomes apparent that he does not intend to return to the old hart to study, which saddens Rubus. Early in the mornings though, Rubus begins to notice his youngest daughter sneaking out at the break of dawn, and becomes curious as to her whereabouts. Tracking the child, Rubus finds a hoard of Oxx's old scripts and studies tucked away in the back of the daughter's den. Rubus doesn't bring it up with his family or let the daughter know of his findings, but some part of him takes pride in knowing the young girl found a way to put his heart at ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult6,Thankfulness,"Hedera remains distant from the group, trying not to impose any more than he has to. Even Rubus seems to back off to some degree, sensing the change in the hart's attitude. The tension between them flares for a while, and then dies down, and finally Rubus comes knocking on Hedera's door to talk. The two stay up late into the night, discussing the well-being of the forest and how to proceed with the current findings. It's all very cordial, but in the end Rubus has a word or two to spare talking about how meaningful their cooperation is. It shouldn't have hit the hart as hard as it did, but Hedera finds himself surprisingly moved by those words.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult6,A Clue As To Why This Is Familiar,"Sternella sits on the Summerstone for several days, pondering. She sits there and zones out for long amounts of time, to the point that pretty much every creature becomes concerned for her well-being. Sternella keeps at it though, gazing off into the sun for more hours then is probably healthy, and then, out of the blue, comes a revalation! The Summerstone beneath her hands becomes warm and fluid, a rock made up of blood and sunlight. There's no solid matter or state, just an empty form which used to be. Sternella blinks her eyes, and the vision fades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult6,Blackbird & Meadowlark,"The Spirit of Night is overcome with her past, scraping through every memory and the haze of age to try to dig up anything that could help the group investigate the attack on the mice. There's little to be found though, a fact which disturbs Agelaius quite deeply. She searches and searches for answers, but nothing in her mind yields results. The only memories that sit with her are strange scenes of being aflight, or being some bewinged creature in the forest long ago. She recalls a time where she was naught but a studier of the arcane arts, and Sternella was nothing more than a singer among the trees. Oh how far had they come?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OxxResult6,The Sun is Free,"The young mouse Oxx hunts in the daytime with the wolves, basks in the sun in the evenings, and sleeps among the monstrous beasts at night. Despite his size and stature, he is treated well among the hounds, and life is good. He forgets more and more about what he was meant to do, but something continues to nag at the back of his head. Soon the food tastes more like ash, and the sun doesn't seem as warm. Oxx tries to delight in the simplicities of the day, but keeps falling back to thinking about others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult6,Hello?,"Bark was never one to really socialize during the days or nights, and truth be told there were few in the forest who would count the old dog as a friend. Needless to say, the silence among the trees was jarring regardless. And so, of course, Bark took it upon himself to visit every creature of the forest individually and check in to how they were doing that day. Most found these visits charming. Others tried to eat him. Bark made it home in one piece though, so it seemed as though things ended up working out alright. The ones who tried to eat him later reflected on how quaint the encounter had been anyways, and how they seemed to be missing several teeth afterwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult7,Empty Nest,"Late in the night, Rubus awakes to the sound of someone throwing pebbles inside his den. When he rises to go investigate, he finds none other than the small fieldmouse, Oxx, standing outside his den. The wolf speaks with Oxx for a while, and Oxx explains that he's heard the rumors about mystical happenings, and that he wants to leave and serve the Summerstone once more. Rubus is hesitant at first, asking if this is truly what Oxx wants. He assures Oxx that he can have a home among the wolves, but Oxx is insistent upon going. The two are filled with sorrow at parting, but Oxx gives Rubus a hug before skittering off into the night. Rubus returns to sleep, expecting to feel some shame at having let the young mouse down. But it doesn't come. Deep down, part of him is happy that the mouse has returned to his studies, and perhaps the best thing Rubus had to offer was the time and family needed for the child to make his own decision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult7,Mortal Magics,"The old hart Hedera prepares his components for divination, staying up deep into the night with the moss and bone he gathered from the deepest ravines of the Durell Woods. It takes quite some time, enough time that... Hedera is certain he has ascertained nothing. There is no glipse of the future, nor of what to do to prepare. One could take this as a sign that the Summerstone had failed him, but another thought hung around Hedera's antlers all through the day: perhaps is was not a failure to prepare, but a sign that there was nothing to be done. Perhaps the time was simply not right, or perhaps... even the mighty Summerstone may not know such things.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult7,Rabbits,"A group of rabbits find their way to the Summerstone's area, setting up hutches and tables all around the edge of the clearing. Rubus tries to usher them away after the first few gather, but there's not a lot that can be said to dissuade the beasts. Sternella calls the rabbits together and asks why they're here, only to find that the rabbits followed the line of clover leading from thier settlement to the area. The elder rabbits offer their wisdom on the situation, but unfortunately it does not prove to be very useful. Nonetheless, the rabbits build pathways stretching from their homeland to the Summerstone, as well as to a few other civilizations that they trade with. More and more mortals stop by and converse with Sternella as she sits by the Summerstone, listening to her riddles and swapping stories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult7,The Slumber of Night,"As night falls once again in the forest, the spirit Agelaius once again finds herself watching over the Summerstone in her solemn state. She listens as the creatures of the forest scurry back to their homes, either sleeping away the long night or whittling away at a project before bedtime. She wonders to herself what exactly she would be doing, were she not compelled to watch over the rock, but nothing comes to mind. At first, this thought is concerning. Surely there is more to a spirit's purpose than to sit idly by. But as time goes on, night after night, Agelaius's heart swells with pride as she sees the creatures skitter past. It is a simple thing to enjoy, but it is what brings her happiness. For now, that would be enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OxxResult7,Reunion,"Oxx abandons his home with the wolves, much to Rubus's surprise. For a while, everyone is on edge, looking for the missing mouse. Oxx begins to show up dilligently to polish the Summerstone, though, as he had before. It is Hedera who finally confronts him about the matter, asking about his change. Oxx explained that he had been travelling late at night when he thought he saw a mouse run past him. He ran and ran, desperately trying to find his missing kin, and was led to a field full of ghost mice. He had one last reunion with his family, and met so many who had died long before he had been born. When morning came about, he knew that there was no use in pretending to be a wolf. He didn't understand why his family had insisted on sending him to Hedera to learn magic, but the magic he had experienced that night... he knew its importance. He wanted to bring that to others.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult7,Intention,"Bark's treks through the woods are, without a doubt, the most perilous trips anyone could take in such a harmless land. Sometimes, it even seems like the dog is trying his best to get into trouble. He purposely misses a step while going down the stairs, tumbles around, and somehow falls into a nice fluffy bed of moss. Other times, he misjudges a leap and falls straight into the rapid river, only to land perfectly onto a passing log shaped to his liking as a boat. Some would say he goes looking for trouble, testing whatever spirits may be to see if they'll keep him safe. It's wild to find that he's still in one piece, after all this time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult8,Picking up the Pieces,"The creatures of the forest swap hushed whispers at who could have done such a thing to the Summerstone, and the wolves are collectively disturbed at the thought of a traitor in their midst. There's unrest everywhere, but the creatures band together to pull through and do what they can for the Summerstone. The larger creatures pick up the remnants of the Summerstone and hoist them back into place, and the smaller critters hunt for every last pebble broken from the rock. Soon enough, the Summerstone stands once more. It is cracked and withered, but it is whole.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult8,Correction,"The old hart spends his time gathering his things, and slowly rebuilds the Summerstone, piece by piece. He pushes together the broken halves of the stone with his massive antlers, his hooves digging into the soft earth around the alter as he does so. It takes every ounce of his strength to correct the stone's position, and every spark of magic within his bones to seal the cracks running throughout the rock. When the process is finished, though, the Summerstone stands tall. Weathered and beaten, aglow with foreign magics, but the Summerstone stands.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OxxResult8,Persistance,"The days were quiet at the Summerstone for most of the week. Visitors were few, and the forest creatures kept mostly to themselves. The lone visitor was, of course, the timid fieldmouse who'd begun his work at the Summerstone in earnest at last. Day and night, the mouse ran about picking up the scattered remains of the Summerstone, piecing it all back together. He built and built and build until there was enough shade cast by the stone for him to rest beneath it. Then he built some more, and finally the work was complete. The Summerstone stood as tall as it had the day it had been broken, though its pieces were from any rock or pebble small enough to be carried by the fieldmouse. Others would tell you, though, that somehow it looked no different than before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult8,Heel,"The young fieldmouse, Oxx would share the story that would baffle the residents of the woods for the remainder of the week. As the fieldmouse returned to his work at the Summerstone, he found the bumbling Bark busily pushing the pieces of the rock back together. Confused and not wanting to disturb the man, Oxx hid in the bushes nearby, watching silently. But, by the time he had hidden and poked his little nose back out, the dog was nowhere to be seen. The Summerstone, however, stood sealed and shut once more, though, repaired almost seamlessly by the strange creature. Oxx scurried up and down the stone, looking for any sort of mark to indicate what had happened, or how such a miracle had occurred, but the fabled Bark wasn't even anywhere to be found afterwards, and the stone was perfect.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult9,Hoarder,"Rubus sets upon the unappealing task of starting to sort through his father's hoard of books, this time with a plan. Now that the creatures have returned to the Durrell woods, it's easy to gather groups of animals willing to sort through and categorize the books. Getting them out of Bark's residence is a bit of a chore, but it's made much easier by the mysterious dissapearance of the dog. Bark's vanishing act finally causes some distress to Rubus on the third day, so he begins his search for his missing father. He finds Bark seemingly talking to his shadow, utterly engaged with the conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DeerResult9,The Scribe,"An eager Hedera begins to sort through the books that Rubus steals from his father, Bark. The first day is tense but excited, as he works his way through books one-by-one. He notices quickly, though, that Rubus didn't lie. Not only is the hand-writing in the books horrendous, but there's not much substance to be found within either. Most of the books just remark on Bark's everyday life, strange but simple. The poor writing slows him down considerably, so Hedera begins to skip through and only read the first page or so. By the end of the week, Hedera is simply looking at the covers and judging whether or not they're worth the time. Perhaps there was no arcana to be found in this stash after all, and the hart decides maybe quantity isn't as good as quality in this case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DayResult9,A Broader Family,"Creatures come and go from the Summerstone once again, happy to see the stone is restored. The spirits of night and day flitter overhead, watching as they pass by, but many start to go out of their way to go speak with the spirits as well. At first, they are shocked by overwhelming percent of creatures who come their way as well, and clarify that they do not grant wishes like the Summerstone. The creatures still come though, less eager to voice their worries, and more eager to simply check-in on the once-beaten spirits. The kind words paramount as time goes on, and Sternella watches the creatures leave everyday with love in her heart.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NightResult9,The Price of a Question,"Life begins to resume as normal for most creatures, save for those rallied by Rubus to raid his father's libraries. Questions plague Agelaius though about her past, and why certain things have only come into light right now. She wonders frequently about how she came to be a spirit, and what such things mean to those alive such as Hedera. When she finally voices her concerns, the old Hart laughs, much to her surprise. Hedera confesses that he would much rather be in her role, then in his own as the arcana expert of the forest. For as much as he knows, it seems a lack of knowledge is far more concerning to him than an excess of it. Agelaius argues against this for a while, but eventually concedes to her post once more. While content is not a word oft used to describe someone such as herself, she finds that she has a lot to work through and ponder. A task which, admittedly, keeps her busier and happier than she's been in a long time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OxxResult9,Fount of Wisdom,"The creatures of the Durrell Woods pitch in and help the wolf lord slowly move Bark's library out of his house for sorting and organizing. Bark namely objects to this, and doesn't hesitate to bark angrily at his son as they steal all of his literature. Oxx, though, desides the best way to calm down the old dog would be doing what he wanted to do anyways, ask Bark more questions on why this all happened. Bark happily obliges, chatting with Oxx for long lengths of time and slowly forgetting the moving happening around in the barkground. Oxx and Rubus are both happy with this arrangement, though Oxx's fears are confirmed. Bark may have written a lot of books, but all of the tales he tells Oxx are very abstract and lack... er... substance. Oxx hoped that at least Rubus was able to find something useful, as he listened to Bark tell the same story about blackberry bushes for the third time that week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BarkResult9,Bark Bark,"Rubus pays more and more unexpected visits to his father's household, ushering more and more of his books away. Bark complains every time he manages to sneak more away, despite Rubus insisting it's for the good of the forest. Finally, the two square off, with Bark kicking out Rubus in an unseen battle that any creature in the forest would have loved to witness. Rubus runs home with his tail between his legs, but the little mouse Oxx returns with a small stack of scrolls he found hidden in the woods. Oxx entertains Bark for hours with tales of gradeur and romance as Rubus continues to sneak books away, and Bark eventually forgets what he was angry about, shelving the scrolls to read at a later time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
WolfResult10,Nightfall,"The trees are silent as the creatures all stand around the Summerstone, awaiting Riddance's return. Food is passed around, preparations are made, but no one dares leave the glade of the Summerstone now. In the distance, more and more of the woods begins to fade away or be destroyed as the vengeful spirits passes through. No one is left behind in the woods, the creatures all wait for the fight to come.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
