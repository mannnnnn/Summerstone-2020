Week1Win,The Little Things,"Time passed as normal, and there was little doubt that something had changed. It was the small things, like a river thawed out or a new path carved through the woods, that made life more bareable. There was humanity in the way the world was shaped, and love in how it recovered.",,,,,,,
Week1Fail,Slow Progress,"Progress came, little-by-little. The world would not recover in a night, nor did anyone expect it too. Times had been hard, and the obstacles that were to come would require every ounce of strength and luck the creatures could require. It would take time to move forward, but time was all they had.",,,,,,,
Week1Perfect,Surge of Life,"The dead forest sprang to life overnight, though no one was sure just how it all happened. There was no fanfare, no witnesses, just the change brought about. One moment, the Durell woods was on its final stand, and the next it was ageless. The world was just how it was before.",,,,,,,
Week2Win,Cyclic,"Food was a difficult matter for a while. With so many creatures returning with high hopes, it was a sore sight to see a brother or sister hunted for their flesh, or for anyone to go hungry because a berry bush had been plundered too early. Nonetheless, a balance was reached as the forest recovered. Soon there were more and more plants providing more and more food, and the predators grew more lax with their hunting as their own bodies recovered from the starvation which the old forest had set in them.",,,,,,,
Week2Fail,Anarchy,"There was little to be said for how the forest recovered when it came to managing meals. The wolves hunted relentlessly, driven by the spike of hunger in their stomachs, and none other than Rubus led the charge for his people. Unrest settled in the Durell Woods because of their undominable position, but the wolves helped maintain the berries and veggies in the woods as well, conscious of what cycle they had to maintain. It was a fearful time to be small, but you could eat well so long as you watched for the hungry eyes within the underbrush.",,,,,,,
Week2Perfect,Delegation,"Animals fought amonst each other for quite some time, until it was finally Rubus who snapped and pulled everyone in line. Arguments continued for several days, but eventually everyone agreed to a solution for the foreseeable future. It ensured that all would get enough to eat, and that food storage would be available for each faction of animals for a set amount of time, but penalized those who hunted unfairly or hid away their stashes when unnecessary. Rubus himself took one of the biggest hits for his people that day, but the old wolf took the sentence without complaint and carried out the orders to maintain the peace, almost with a bit of pride.",,,,,,,
Week3Win,A Helping Hand,"The creatures of the woods rally together to search for the missing humans. There's not a lot of good leads, but the wolves eventually pick up the scent of an unfamiliar passerby. It takes many days of tracing and retracing steps to find anything fruitful, but at the last minute there's a breakthrough. The humans are found and escorted home joyfully, and the creatures of the forest make note to put up more directional signs in the future.",,,,,,,
Week3Fail,Those Lost to the Forest,"The creatures keep their eyes peeled, but the forest is truly a mysterious place. There is no telling where a human could have gone, and it is unlikely they would have survived long out away from the charted paths. The search continues in modest, but eventually the Lord of Wolves calls it off. The humans have their ways, and the creatures of the forest have theirs. Not all paths were meant to cross.",,,,,,,
Week3Perfect,Men and the Beasts,"The plight of the humans moves the creatures of the Durrell Woods in a way... unexpected of themselves. Predator and prey alike begin to scour the woods, putting aside any sense of malice towards each other. Children explore new places with their friends, and adults light lamps and journey at night to the furthest reaches of the land. Scholars draw maps and collaborate, forming a tight-knit group of researchers who promise to stay together far after this incident is resolved. In the end, it is a pack of wolf pups who find the lost human child and her older brother. They escort them home and live with the humans, looking after them for many years and guiding them through the woods.",,,,,,,
Week4Win,A Pass,"Rubus, Hedera, and Agelaius arrive swiftly to the first colony, but find the mice within slaughtered. They press through, travelling through the Durrell woods at breakneck speed to catch the culprit before he strikes again. All the colonies they visit are destroyed, the mice within mauled by an unknown foe. The towns lay in shambles, and the lone survivor becomes Oxx, who was at Hedera's side during the massacre. The old deer turns back before visiting the final colony, ushering the young mouse away from his hometown before he has a chance to see what has become of it.",,,,,,,
Week4Fail,Too Late,"Rubus, Hedera, and Agelaius rush to the aid of the mice, but the slaughter is throughouly finished by the time they arrive. The final colonies of the mice are strewn about in ruin. The markings on the bodies of the mice match nothing seen before, and there is no culprit in sight. Even the wolves that Rubus sent ahead have no idea what was murdering the mice. The sole survivor is Oxx, who had been at Hedera's side at the time of the attack. He stands alone amongst the shambles of his town long after the others have left, and sleeps within his family's house, empty as it may be.",,,,,,,
Week4Perfect,An Army Against Nothing,"Rubus, Hedera, and Agelaius charge through the forest with the might of the wolf's army at their backs. They arrive at the first colony to find it in shambles, all the mice within mauled and murdered by an unknown assailant. The slaughter is complete, though, and every colony they visit afterwards has fallen in the same way. The lone survivor of the massacre, Oxx, was only alive because he had been at Hedera's side as the attack happened. Rubus helps the young fieldmouse pick his way through the remnants of his hometown, making his way to his family's house. The wolf stays by his side as Oxx wonders whether or not to open to door and see what has become. In the end, the young fieldmouse merely places a twig in front of his family's door, and leaves without another word.",,,,,,,
Week5Win,Stagnant Magic,"The hunt begins for the culprits who pulled off the massacre of the mice. Convinced that this was a supernatural occurence, Hedera and Rubus consult the spirits of Day and Night to fully investigate the matter. The damage is absolute, and there are few traces to go off of as to who conducted the murders. It does seem, however, that the group is on the right trail. Sternella and Agelaius are able to pick up faint traces of magic embodied in the rocks and fauna around the mice's homes. Its trail seems too wide and too stale though, as if the magic had been a part of the forest for quite some time.",,,,,,,
Week5Fail,Few Leads,"There is little to go off of for the investigation. Rubus and Hedera are quickly shoved aside by the spirits of night and day as they begin their investigation. There is turmoil among the group as they debate what sort of being could have caused the massacre. Rubus and Hedera interrogate and investigate all the wildlife and forces they can command, but there are no leads. Sternella and Agelaius, convinced that this was a supernatural occurence, try looking beyond what can be seen. The only thing they find, though is the forest's magic, same as it ever was.",,,,,,,
Week5Perfect,The Old Magic,"There is no doubt that whatever killed the mice was something far beyond the control of mortals. As such, the spirits of night and day spearhead the investigation, pooling together thier brilliant arcana knowledge to try to find a lead. Despite their years of experience though, they find nothing out of the ordinary by the mice's settlements. The magic which hangs in the air is stale and wide-spread, magic that has been a part of the forest for many a year. Rubus and Hedera initially dismiss this as being a false lead, but the spirits know better.",,,,,,,
Week6Win,The Mouse's Instincts,"The young fieldmouse frets and worries through the night, until he can take it no longer. He jumps out of bed and rushes back to the Summerstone, digging around and around the area, searching for answers. There is heavy magic hanging in the air, magic that not even Hedera himself could sense. It takes a mouse's fine instincts to track such a thing, and something has felt off about this place. Oxx follows his instincts and continues to dig, unearthing the bones of the Summerstone's previous sacrifice. He digs deeper, searching for the bones of the other Summerstones but nothing remains. No magic or ivory to be found. Oxx stays a while, but eventually heads home. Before he departs though, he plucks a few wildflowers and leaves them on the Summerstone, looking back at it with confusion and worry.",,,,,,,
Week6Fail,Weekend6Fail,"The days of joy and peace among the wolves were happy times in Oxx's life, but still something nagged at him to go. The innate sense of magic pulsing in Oxx's small frame urged him to follow his lead, to go investigate what had torn his family away from him. Late one night, he set out to settle things once and for all, but... standing on the edge of the wolves dens, he felt a sense of unease wash over his heart. He looked into the yawning unknown, and a fear set into his heart. Scurrying back into the dens, Oxx beat back the call of magic, and drifted off into a deep sleep.",,,,,,,
Week6Perfect,The Missing Bones,"Oxx was a fieldmouse, and the last one at that. Hedera had picked him long ago as a bit of a charity case, but he had never realized the true potential in Oxx's arcanic instincts. Whereas harts such as Hedera could sense magic, mice like Oxx could practically taste it. It was a sweet wine, a sort of intoxicating allure that was difficult to ignore. Sure, Hedera and the spirits had been searching for the mice's murderers elsewhere, but Oxx knew that the heart of the problem lay in the grove of the Summerstone. In the dead of night, Oxx dug and dug, searching for the bones of the other sacrified Summerstones near the alter, but nothing surfaced. The only set of bones remaining were that of the current Summerstone, and magic pulsed through those ivory beams. Oxx reburied the bones, confused at the meaning. There had to be more, there had to be...",,,,,,,
Week7Win,Savagery,"The creature at the edge of the clearing pounces, its torso propelled only by a strong set of dirty human arms pulling it forward. It's impossible to make out the creature, moving at such high speeds. Sternella manages to knock it off course as it launches itself at the Summerstone, but the creature grabs ahold of her instead. It bites down into her shoulder with a sickening crunch, and Sternella falls. Agelaius rushes forward, but the creature has already descended upon the Summerstone. With its bare hands, it pulls the rock apart, grasping at it with a primal fury and severing the magic stone in twain. The Spirit of Night looks on with horror as the creature turns her way and in a split second is at her throat. She fends off the creature just barely, with the wounds to show for it, and it scuttles back into the darkness where it had come from.",,,,,,,
Week7Fail,Annihilation,"Something attacks, viciously and quickly. It flies past Sternella and Agelaius as they stand guard at the Summerstone. Its crawls along the ground, human hands stretching forward and pulling it at the stone at a neck-break pace. There's a wail as it sinks its flat teeth into the rock, ripping it appart, and all that the stone once was falls apart. Sternella is the first to react as the creature lunges past, and she tries to tackle it as it finishes its work. The creature descends on her in an instant, writing under her grip and flipping her into the remains of the stone as it bites into her arm. Agelaius counters as the Spirit of Day goes still, but the creature is already biting for her legs. She tries to pry it off, but it continues to gnaw away at the bone until there is nothing left, and there is no one to observe what happens after the attack.",,,,,,,
Week7Perfect,Counter,"The thing lurking on the edge of the clearing, it's almost human in appearance. A torso and two long, dirty arms stretch out and propel it forward, fingernails blackened and blunt. Sternella and Agelaius strike in unison as the creature tries to launch itself between them to attack the Summerstone, and the creature is hurled back to the edge of the clearing. The spirits ask why it has come, and it does not answer. It simply waits for another opportunity to get past. An hour passes, and then another, but finally Sternella and Agelaius stand aside, curious to see what the creature will do. The creature pulls itself forward on its winding arms and embraces the Summerstone, holding it for a moment before ripping the rock clean in half. The spirits rush forward but the creature pulls them aside when they get to close, jostling their arm bones from their sockets by the sheer strength of the creature. They still try to fight. They don't win.",,,,,,,
Week8Win,Return of the Spirits,"Agelaius and Sternella return to their post at the Summerstone, beaten and battered, but healing. The stone is intact for now, and the creatures of the Durrell Woods begin to return to it once more. They watch the spirits at their post now with opened eyes, though, and many of the creatures come bearing meals and salves for the injured spirits. At first, the spirits turn these gifts away, staying true to their posts, but Rubus and Hedera take them in secret and aid the spirits once the visitors have left. The spirits recover, and everyone's mirth is restored as Sternella and Agelaius stand proudly at their perches once more alongside the restored Summerstone.",,,,,,,
Week8Fail,Tied to a Post,"The spirits return to their post, still badly beaten and injured. There's no rest for the two as visitors begin to return. Creatures of the woods cast mournful eyes at the broken spirits, and keep their visits short and cordial to allieve the pair. The guards of the Summerstone lay broken, but the stone itself still stands, and for that there is some cause for rejoicing. Rubus and Hedera, though, watch the spirits with a lingering sense of dread, knowing that the two of them may soon be filling the roles with Sternella and Agelaius cling to now.",,,,,,,
Week8Perfect,The Summerstone Heals,"Agelaius and Sternella once again take up their posts beside the Summerstone, both bearing grave injuries from their fight against the previous Summerstone's spirit. They stand strong though, guarding against a foe that they cannot possibly hope to defeat in their state. Rubus and Hedera stay nearby, concerned for the well-being of the spirits, and bearing the weight of the thought that they too should one day fill the shoes of the spirits. The wolf and the hart lay at the edge of the clearing when they see a bright light envelop the spirits. They rush to their aid, thinking the foe has returned, but instead watch as a magical light reknits the torn flesh and bones of the spirits. Ribbons of light wrap around their bodies, healing all that has been broken, and the spirits collapse in each other's arms, happily weeping at the other's recovery. The Summerstone watches overhead, glowing with the luminescent magic as it dies away and leaves them whole once more.",,,,,,,
Week9Win,The Rally Call,"Rubus and Hedera pool their efforts together, taking up the mantle of leaders within the forest and rallying together all creatures to defend the Summerstone. The way the wind moves through the trees, the groaning of the sky as it shifts from day to night once more... the tension is palpable as the world awaits Riddance's retaliation. Words is passed throughout ranks upon ranks of creatures of the story of the Summerstone, of how it truly came to be, and what Rubus and Hedera had done. They stand together, ready to defend the forest with their lives.",,,,,,,
Week9Fail,The Wolves Lurk,"The wolves heed the call right away, gathered around the Summerstone to defend it from the mysterious threats lurking nearby. Rubus and Hedera pour over texts and try to figure out how to win this impossible battle, but there is little to be said for how to fight such an unknown creature. Riddance's presence is felt everywhere, lurking through every aspect of the woods that he once controlled and maintained himself. The creatures of the woods flee to their Summerstone in fright, making their desperate stand against this vengeful creature, and hoping that their descendants would not have to repeat this cycle.",,,,,,,
Week9Perfect,We Live Here,"There's an eeirie silence that falls over the Summerstone's glade once again as the days become tense for the coming battle. Agelaius and Sternella wait out the silence, poised and ready to strike at anything that dares challenge the rock again. While they vow not to become distracted in their vigil, a strange drowsiness settles upon them late one night, and they fall into a deep sleep. Rubus and Hedera return in the morning to rouse the spirits, and nearly run in fright as both the spirits of Day and Night awake brandishing weapons of unimaginable power. Sternella weilds the Harbringer's Spear, and Agelaius the Celestial Lance. All the creatures, even the friends they've come to know and love, stay well away from the Summerstone for several days, trembling at the sight of the two weapons. As the call to arms is put out, everyone realizes that the time has come for this change, and that the fight coming in the days ahead would be the last fight for the fate of the Durrell Woods.",,,,,,,
Week10Win,Riddance,"The creature returns, Riddance in its full regalia. A swarming beast, mind lost long ago from its imprisonment in the stone. The creatures stand stalwart against their adversary. This creature which once protected them had come to harm, had taken away all that it had given. There is fear in the hearts of everyone, but there is also resolve. They stand strong, and begin the fight. Riddance dashes through the beasts, cutting and ripping at whatever lies in its path. Many are cut down, but a few manage to fight back. The spirits of Day and Night fight with the fury of the guardiancs that they were meant to be, slashing and driving back the mad spirit. Little Oxx picks up his magics once more and accompanies the clueless Bark to protect whomever they can amidst the chaos. In the end though, it is Rubus and Hedera who stand by the stone, the final protectors of the one they had first slain. They stand by the stone, and they die by it.",,,,,,,
Week10Fail,Weekend10Fail,Let's take away a fail state here...,,,,,,,
Week10Perfect,Good Riddance,"The creature returns, Riddance in its full regalia. A swarming beast, mind lost long ago from its imprisonment in the stone. The creatures stand stalwart against their adversary. This creature which once protected them had come to harm, had taken away all that it had given. There is fear in the hearts of everyone, but there is also resolve. They stand strong, and begin the fight. Riddance dashes through the beasts, cutting and ripping at whatever lies in its path. Many are cut down, but a few manage to fight back. The spirits of Day and Night fight with the fury of the guardiancs that they were meant to be, slashing and driving back the mad spirit.

In the end though, it is Rubus and Hedera who stand by the stone, the final protectors of the one they had first slain. They stand by the stone, and they die by it. But of course, only the foolish would believe that the Summerstone itself were without its own defenses. Torn apart, sacrificed, the spirit still burns strong. Riddance is but a husk of what this one once was. Of course there would be no contest in the end between the Summerstone and its ghost.",,,,,,,
