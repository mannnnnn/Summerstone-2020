- O: Hello Miss Summerstone.
- O: The lords of the forest said you were sleeping-.
- O: So I'll be quiet.
- O: Thank you for coming back.
- O: We could really use some sunshine today.
- O: But, its okay if you can't do that yet.
- H: Oxx? What are you doing?
- O: Oh!
- O: Sorry Mister Hedera.
- O: I was cleaning the alter, like you instructed, sir.
- H: Good.
- H: It looks well enough kept for now. Run along to your studies.
- O: Yes, Mister Hedera.
- H: Mm...
- B: Quite the noisy fellow, dontcha think?
- H: Typically quiet as a mouse, I'm surprised he's so stirred as of late.
- H: ...
- H: My apologies, do I know you?
- B: Doubt it.
- H: Mm.
- B: ...
- H: And are you going to introduce yourself?
- B: Now why would I do that?
- H: Because it's-
- H: He's gone.
- H: That's fine.
- O: Mighty Hedera, I have a question.
- H: Have you thought it over?
- O: Yes, teacher.
- H: Is it something important?
- O: Um...
- O: It's important to me?
- H: Very well, what is your question?
- O: Why is the Lord of Wolves stopping by your home so much as of late?
- O: Does he also serve the Summerstone?
- H: He abets me in my work, but not to fear.
- H: I shall speak with him to keep his presence light. Do not be frightened.
- O: Oh no! Professor Hedera, I-I don't mind the wolf lord at all.
- O: He takes care of everyone! Even my little village.
- H: He most certainly has not taken good care of the world as it stands today.
- H: Were he a just leader, there would not be such an influx of wolves-
- H: And yet a shortage of mice.
- O: So... Lord Rubus was responsible for all the disasters that befell my family?
- H: Well no, I wouldn't say that.
- H: Those disasters will cease to be with the new Summerstone.
- H: After all, look at how the forest has flourished.
- O: Right, things can only get better.
