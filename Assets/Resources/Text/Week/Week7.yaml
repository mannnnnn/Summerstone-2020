- B: ~La da do da do!~
- S: ~La da do da do day!~
- A: Enough.
- A: Who are you, why do you keep coming back here.
- S: ...
- S: And there he goes.
- A: Is he an idiot?
- S: I would imagine so, though quite a cheerful one.
- S: Ah! Oxx!
- O: Hello, Noble Sternella and Agelaius.
- S: Welcome back! How's like been treating you so far?
- A: Sternella...
- O: Oh, I'm fine missus. I...
- O: Do... do you always stay here?
- S: I sure do! Agelaius and I never leave the Summerstone anymore.
- A: There are strange happenings about.
- O: Yes, that why I was wondering.
- O: You two don't see anything strange around here?
- S: Plenty of strange things, hun! Unfortunately though, no sign or smell of any evildoer.
- S: You'd think a mad creature would be easy to flush out the forest.
- A: I hardly concurr.
- A: If it's a mad beast, it would no doubt escape our gaze.
- A: We watch over the Summerstone, not the forest.
- A: What happens out there is, unfortunately, not our domain.
- O: But why do you stay here? Why do you keep watch?
- S: Well that's simple, we- uh...
- S: Um...
- A: We are guardians of... err...
- A: Well.
- A: Maybe, we ourselves do not know.
- O: Then... why stay?
- S: Something's coming.
- O: What sort of something?
- A: If we knew, then we'd warn you all.
- A: But we know nothing.
- S: Call it a hunch.
- A: Whatever enemy killed your people, it still lurks in the shadows.
- A: We'll keep watch day and night to see if we can get a glimpse.
- O: And you'll catch them?
- A: We will.
- A: I only pray we will be enough.
