- R: I have my doubts about talking to a rock.
- H: The Summerstone is a powerful device, Rubus.
- H: Do you even understand where you stand?
- R: I remember asking you why the forest was dying-
- R: -You mumbling off on some mumbo-jumbo about rocks-
- R: -And somehow convincing me that a ritual had to be performed.
- H: The Summerstone has existed for many hundred years.
- H: My mentor, and their mentor before them- they all were born after its creation.
- H: But the stories they pass down, they hold such weight.
- H: There is little doubt that it is truly the Summerstone which rules this world of ours.
- R: This world of ours...
- R: Then it's to blame for the droughts, the grey skies, and the injuries which my people have endured?
- H: Yes and no.
- H: The Summerstone is two beings, the rock itself and the spirit.
- H: The stone endures, but the spirit cycles.
- H: A new spirit has come to oversee our lives now. Surely, they will steer us right.
- R: Well then, spirit of the Summerstone. How about some good weather, hm?
- R: The forest is abandoned. Just us few left around in its shambles.
- R: Your predecessor killed everything, made our lives miserable.
- R: We just want things back to the way they were, no better.
- H: It is unwise to make requests from the spirit at this time. They know best.
- H: Allow the spirit to work its course in due time.
- R: That's what we did the last time, and that's how people got killed.
- R: A spirit tied to a rock knows nothing of mortal struggles.
- R: Listen to me, O Summerstone. We need help.
