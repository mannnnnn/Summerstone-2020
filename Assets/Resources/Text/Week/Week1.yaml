- R: Such barbaric practices, stealing away travellers in the middle of night...
- H: Is that not what your children do, Rubus?
- H: You seem to only feign distaste when I suggest the course of action.
- R: I'm just saying I didn't want to be involved in this, that's all.
- H: And yet you show up on my doorstep with your pack asking for this exact miracle.
- H: If the forest is to survive, then sacrifices must be made.
- R: And that sacrifice has to be an innocent bystander lost in the woods?
- H: Are you volunteering for the position?
- R: ...
- H: I thought not.
- H: Now, pay tribute to the spirit of the Summerstone, before we set it free.
- R: And thank it for what, killing our land?
- R: Driving out the families that once called this place home?
- H: Thank it for its many, many years of service to this forest.
- H: And bid it a swift journey onwards.
- R: Hmph.
- R: Thank you, O Summerstone.
- H: Under your direction, we have seen this forest thrive and wither through many a-year.
- H: But the time has come to change hands. Summerstone, we bid you farewell.
- R: And good riddance.
- H: Now... bring the human forward.
- R: This is barbaric.
- R: At least let me take off the bag before you-

- H: It is done. The traveler has become one with the Summerstone. It can hear us now.
- R: I have my doubts about talking to a rock.
- H: The Summerstone is a powerful device, Rubus.
- H: Do you even understand where you stand?
- R: I remember asking you why the forest was dying-
- R: -You mumbling off on some mumbo-jumbo about rocks-
- R: -And somehow convincing me that a ritual had to be performed.
- H: The Summerstone has existed for many hundred years.
- H: My mentor, and their mentor before them- they all were born after its creation.
- H: But the stories they pass down, they hold such weight.
- H: There is little doubt that it is truly the Summerstone which rules this world of ours.
- R: This world of ours...
- R: Then it's to blame for the droughts, the grey skies, and the injuries which my people have endured?
- H: Yes and no.
- H: The Summerstone is two beings, the rock itself and the spirit.
- H: The stone endures, but the spirit cycles.
- H: A new spirit has come to oversee our lives now. Surely, they will steer us right.
- R: Well then, spirit of the Summerstone. How about some good weather, hm?
- R: The forest is abandoned. Just us few left around in its shambles.
- R: Your predecessor killed everything, made our lives miserable.
- R: We just want things back to the way they were, no better.
- H: It is unwise to make requests from the spirit at this time. They know best.
- H: Allow the spirit to work its course in due time.
- R: That's what we did the last time, and that's how people got killed.
- R: A spirit tied to a rock knows nothing of mortal struggles if we just let it 'work its course'.
- R: Listen to me, O Summerstone. We need help.
