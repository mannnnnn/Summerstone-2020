- R: You said that the Summerstone would help!
- H: And it has, in many ways.
- R: But not where it matters most?
- R: Besides Oxx, the fieldmouse population is dead!
- S: Those poor, sweet creatures.
- A: We did what we could, but that was limited.
- R: The Summerstone is supposed to be protecting us.
- R: How could it allow this to happen?
- H: I... I'm not sure myself.
- R: I was a fool for going along with this.
- R: We have no idea what sort of spirit we brought into the Summerstone.
- R: I should've never agreed to this ritual.
- H: But doesn't it strike you as odd?
- H: The forest has been healing.
- S: Yes, we've seen it ourselves after all!
- A: We would never have returned if it wasn't so.
- R: Trading the forest for his family will be little comfort to Oxx.
- R: Or to me.
- H: The loss of the mice is beyond words.
- H: If this was any fault of the Summerstone then we must take action-
- R: Finally something we can agree on.
- H: -But we need to know the origins of this attack and if they connect to the Summerstone.
- H: Sternella and Agelaius, may I humbly ask for your aid in this matter?
- S: Hmm, taking orders isn't exactly how we do things, old hack.
- S: But since you're groveling so nicely... Agelaius?
- A: We can make an exception.
- A: We will let you know if we discover anything of note.
