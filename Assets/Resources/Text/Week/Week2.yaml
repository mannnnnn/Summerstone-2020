- S: Well I thought I felt a change in the weather.
- A: Or perhaps in the very nature of the world itself.
- H: Ah, Sternella and Agelaius. Pleasure to see the two of you back.
- R: You know these people?
- S: Everyone knows us, silly!
- R: Clearly I don't.
- A: You most certainly do, even if you don't recognize us old friends of yours.
- S: For I am the spirit of day-
- A: And I the spirit of night.
- H: A powerful duo indeed.
- A: And ones that are most curious about the proceedings of the past week.
- A: What is stranger, that the forest is suddenly rejuvinated-?
- S: With all its critters and scamperers running about?
- A: Or perhaps, the strange signs in the sky which caught our eye?
- S: A little more light on the horizon, to spring hope in their hearts.
- A: Or even stranger still, the mighty king of wolves-
- A: Playing magic play-pretend with the lonesome hart?
- R: Believe me when I say it was not by choice.
- R: The forest was dead, and I knew the source laid behind the hart's magics.
- R: Had I any other option, I would have struck out for it.
- S: But how did Hedera fix the forest?
- S: I thought you were a washed-up apprentice, old sport!
- H: It has been many a year since I was called an apprentice of the magical arts.
- H: Hr... and longer still since I have been called a 'sport'.
- H: But my mentor spoke of the Summerstone to me, even when I was but a young lad.
- H: I knew that if anything could revive the forest, it would be the stone.
- A: And if anything could destroy it, it would also be the Summerstone.
- H: ...Yes, that is likely so.
- S: And so you fixed it?
- H: In a sense of the word, yes.
- R: What do you mean, 'In a sense of the word'.
- R: You told me you fixed the Summerstone.
- R: That's why we went to such drastic measures.
- R: Are you saying there's a chance that it's NOT fixed?
- H: Well... I never said I knew why the forest died.
- H: But the Summerstone does not exist to restore the forest.
- H: The Summerstone MAINTAINS the forest.
- H: It was a last resort option. The only thing I could think of bringing on such blight.
- S: Lovely to know that the hart magician's brilliant success was a hack.
- S: Really puts my mind at ease about returning to this place.
- R: You intend to stay?
- A: We're both old, and young.
- A: We know little of the Summerstone, but are intrigued.
- A: We will be patient and investigate what we can.
- S: With luck, maybe this'll all turn out in the end!
