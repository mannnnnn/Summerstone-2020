- H: I wish...
- R: ?
- H: I wish we had someone to turn to.
- H: Some text or tome that had more knowledge on the Summerstone.
- H: My mentor barely covered the topic, sadly.
- H: So neither Oxx nor myself knows of the last Summerstone's spirit.
- R: But if we ask someone older than your mentor?
- H: Older? Hah!
- H: My mentor lived to be a hearty ten years of age!
- H: I'm sure there isn't a soul in the forest that lived to meet both him and myself.
- R: Hedera, I'm nearly 200 years old.
- H: O-oh.
- H: Is that so?
- H: Well, you barely look a day-
- R: But I didn't know anything about the Summerstone during that time, or any sort of sacrifice that occurred.
- R: My father is much older than I am though.
- R: He might have a book or two that could enlighten us.
- H: Or we could ask the man himself?
- R: I would recommend against it.
- R: There's a reason that airhead doesn't run the forest.
- O: Are we going to see Bark, good wolf lord?
- R: Aye, we're going to see old man Bark.
- H: Bark?
- H: You mean, that pompous dog that's been running about?
- R: The very same.
- R: My father, nearly 500 years of age.
- H: You're kidding me.
- R: Unfortunately no.
- R: And unfortunately, he's the most likely person to help us out here.
- R: Bark records the history of the forest, lest it be forgotten.
- R: And it seems as though we've forgotten.
- H: How many times did I explain to you that I could not unravel the arcane mysteries of the Summerstone!
- H: And how many times did you fault me for my lack of knowledge, when a fount was nearby!
- R: Calm yourself, Hart.
- R: I asked Bark on your behalf.
- R: His answers were just... lacking substance.
- H: And what does that mean?
- O: Um... he doesn't really seem to know things.
- O: He just writes them down.
- O: And his notes are hard to read.
- R: But if we get the forest together, spend the week digging through his notes-
- R: We might find something.
- H: Very well.
- H: An entire library, hidden under my nose.
- H: I thought Oxx and I were the only ones who could read in this whole forest!
- O: That's why reading Bark's scribblings are so difficult...
