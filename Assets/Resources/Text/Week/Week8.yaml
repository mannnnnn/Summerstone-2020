- R: Don't move.
- A: Tch...
- A: I can't even feel myself being moved.
- A: Is Sternella awake yet?
- R: No.
- R: Focus on yourself for now.
- R: Can you feel this?
- A: Still no.
- A: Where's the hart? Surely he's not busy.
- A: And surely he's a better healer than-
- R: Must you do this now?
- A: ...
- A: Where's the deer.
- R: At the Summerstone, trying to...
- R: -Comprehend, shall we say, what happened.
- A: What happened-
- A: WHat happened is that some THING leapt out of the forest and tore apart the Summerstone.
- A: It destroyed it! Ripped it in twain, I saw it!
- A: What beast of yours can pull rocks apart like that?!
- R: It was no beast of mine, I can assure you of that.
- R: And might I remind you, I am no spirit.
- R: I lead the forest, but I do not hold dominion over those within.
- R: I can only tell you what I know of those who reside with me.
- R: And I can only heal in the way that mortals have taught me, so hold still.
- A: I should return to the Summerstone.
- R: There is no Summerstone.
- H: There is... for now.
- A: Hedera!
- H: The spirit is still within the stone, but it is loose.
- H: Tied to the spot, but not encapsulated.
- A: And what does that mean?
- H: Nothing good.
- R: Specifically?
- H: You still ask for specifics, even at a time like this?
- H: What do I know of these things? When has this ever happened before?
- H: I study the magics of this forest, but this is unprecedented. 
- H: I have nothing solid to tell you two.
- R: But it's fairly clear this is bad?
- H: I cannot see this being good in any way, yes.
- A: Whatever attacked us, it's still out there.
- A: We can't stop it if it returns.
- A: And we can't keep it from killing anyone else.
- H: I am aware.
- R: But... we can try.
- H: Indeed.
- A: ...
- A: And the Summerstone?
- H: What is there to be done, young spirit?
- H: All we can do now is give it rest.
- R: Let it be, just for a while.
- R: We'll see how the forest responds.
- R: And how the rock fares.
