- H: This is absurd! You know he should be-
- R: Don't do this, Hedera.
- R: You're about this level of jealousy.
- H: This is not jealousy!
- H: Oxx has only run from his studies because you have allowed him quarter.
- H: If you would simply tell him to return-
- R: You don't have a family, Hedera. You've gotten cold.
- R: Let him stay in my care for a while.
- R: He's lonely and scared. My pack can keep an eye on him until this investigation is over.
- H: Someone must study the arcane arts, and Oxx is next in line.
- H: He has spent years training, but there is far more for him to learn.
- R: And you consider your position vital to the survival of the forest?
- H: I do. Someone must take it over when I die.
- R: I think you could so with a little sobering up.
- R: We found traces of old magic around the mice, old magic that had permeated the forest.
- R: It had to belong to the Summerstone.
- H: I cannot believe the gall in-
- A: Well here's right.
- S: Sort of.
- S: It's more like... it was a PART of the Summerstone's magic.
- A: The same sort of thing that controls the weather.
- S: Or protects the creatures in a supernatural fasion.
- A: There's all sorts of magic linked to the Summerstone.
- A: Including Hederas.
- R: As in... Hedera killed the mice?
- S: Goodness no! As in, most of the magical creatures here share magic with the Summerstone.
- S: I wouldn't believe our Summerstone was involved at all in the massacre.
- S: After all, if it really didn't want to help us-
- S: It could simply ignore us. Leave us to die.
- A: But it's been listening so far, so it's safe to say that's not the case.
- R: Wonderful, so where does that leave us.
- A: With a mystery on our hands, I'm afraid.
