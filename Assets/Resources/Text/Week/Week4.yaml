- H: ...
- R: Why the long face?
- R: Everything is going well.
- R: Don't tell me you're one of those people who doesn't like when things go well.
- H: Things could be better.
- R: Things could be better?
- R: Really now.
- R: I think things could be a lot worse.
- H: Yes, I concur. However-
- H: There's been some odd scratchings on the Summerstone.
- H: Oxx noticed them yesterday, and brought them to my attention.
- R: Maybe you shouldn't let him tend to the stone any longer.
- R: His little claws might be scuffing the rock.
- H: It's not that.
- H: I don't know what it is.
- R: Alright then, the rock is getting scuffed.
- R: And that's what's causing you to mill about, looking like your tail got bitten off?
- H: No, it's not just that.
- H: The forest has been getting worse.
- R: It still seems like it's getting better to me.
- H: The mice civilizations have been hit hard by the recent onslaught of rain.
- H: Half of the villages drowned. Only four remain.
- R: Half?
- R: What were they doing in flood zones?
- H: They weren't in flood zones, at least not all.
- H: One was even partically up the crest of a hill.
- R: Then how did they drown? There's been nothing but light rain as of late.
- H: I do not know.
- R: And?
- H: And I do not like it when people suffer as a result of me not knowing things.
- H: Forgive my sour attitude.
- H: Things were going so well.
- R: They're still better than before, but-
- R: I will send aid to the mice. We can protect the few who've survived.
- H: See that you do so.
- H: We have come a long way.
- O: ...
- H: Well then, we have our studies to tend to.
- O: Do I have to study still?
- O: I could help Regal Rubus. I should hel-
- H: We must do what we can here, Oxx.
- O: What do you do here?
- O: The Summerstone doesn't need help.
- H: We must... come now, Oxx. You have much to learn.
