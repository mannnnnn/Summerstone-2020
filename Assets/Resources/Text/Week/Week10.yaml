- R: And so, our adversary is none other than the original Summerstone.
- R: These are... disturbing times.
- A: How do you intend to proceed?
- A: You know that Riddance is due to return.
- R: Right.
- R: We must do all we can to prepare before then.
- S: Prepare? My what means are you going to prepare?
- S: We've spent the past several weeks mulling these mysteries over.
- S: But... it's not like we found anything to go off of.
- H: Well... yes and no.
- H: Perhaps we do not have any trap that would ensure our victory.
- H: But, we do have knowledge of our enemy.
- H: As well as...
- R: ...
- H: Well, Rubus and I have a sort of idea.
- H: But we should not rely on such things.
- S: A plan? Oh do tell!

- R: Best not to think to put much stock into it.
- A: Ah, I see.
- S: See what? What do you see?
- A: Let it be, Sternella.
- A: I commend you two for thinking this through.
- H: Trust me when I say this it'll come more on instinct than anything else.
- R: And... please don't let the others know.
- R: There are many people depending on us.
- R: We wouldn't be doing this if we didn't have to.
- R: And hopefully we won't.
- A: I pray that it will not come to such dire circumstances.
- A: But-
- A: You must bunker down and prepare for what is to come.
- A: We will fight with all our might.
- A: With the twin strength of the spirits.
- S: An indominable force!
- A: Mm... well-
- S: We won't fall again!
- A: That's more like it.
- A: Go, you two. Get the others prepared for what is to come.
